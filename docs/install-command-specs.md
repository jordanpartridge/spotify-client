# The Legendary Spotify Client Install Command Specifications

## Vision: The Most Developer-Friendly API Setup Experience Ever Built

### Core Philosophy
Create an install command so intelligent, delightful, and helpful that developers will want to star the repo and share it with others purely based on the setup experience.

## Research-Based Design Principles

### 1. Value-First Approach
- Save developers **hours** of setup time
- Eliminate **all** manual steps where possible
- Provide **immediate** value and working examples
- Create a **magical** experience that "just works"

### 2. Community-Centric Design
- Make developers feel **welcomed** and **supported**
- Provide **clear paths** for engagement
- Build **genuine connections** through excellent UX
- **Celebrate** successful setups

### 3. GitHub Star Strategy (Tasteful & Value-Driven)
- **Earn** stars through exceptional value delivery
- Ask **only after** successful setup and working demo
- **Emphasize** the time and effort saved
- **Invite** to community rather than just asking for stars

## Detailed Command Specifications

### Phase 1: Intelligent Welcome & Discovery
```
🎵 Welcome to Spotify Client for Laravel! 🎵

Let me set up your Spotify API integration with zero hassle.
This should take about 2-3 minutes and I'll handle everything automatically.
```

**Discovery Process:**
- **Laravel App Analysis**: Detect Laravel version, existing packages, app type
- **Environment Detection**: Check .env structure, existing Spotify credentials
- **Project Structure**: Identify if it's API-only, web app, SPA, etc.
- **Developer Context**: Detect development vs production environment

**Smart Intro Messages:**
```
✨ I detected you're using Laravel 11 with Livewire - perfect!
✨ I can see this is a fresh Laravel app - let's get Spotify integrated!
✨ Found existing Spotify credentials - want me to update or create new ones?
```

### Phase 2: Spotify App Registration Wizard

**Step 1: Existing App Detection**
```php
// If we can detect Spotify Developer account
$apps = $this->detectSpotifyApps();

if ($apps->isNotEmpty()) {
    $choice = select(
        'I found existing Spotify apps in your account:',
        $apps->pluck('name', 'id')->prepend('Create a new app', 'new')->toArray(),
        hint: 'Select an existing app or create a new one'
    );
}
```

**Step 2: Browser-Guided App Creation**
```
🌐 Opening Spotify Developer Dashboard...

I'll open your browser to create a new Spotify app.
Don't worry - I'll guide you through each step!

[Press Enter when ready]
```

**Step 3: Smart App Configuration**
- **Auto-suggest app name**: Based on Laravel app name
- **Auto-suggest description**: "Laravel application using Spotify Web API"
- **Auto-configure redirect URIs**: Based on detected Laravel routes
- **Suggest optimal settings**: Based on detected app type

### Phase 3: Authentication Flow Intelligence

**Flow Selection with Smart Recommendations:**
```php
$appType = $this->detectAppType();

$flowRecommendation = match($appType) {
    'api-only' => 'client_credentials',
    'web-with-users' => 'authorization_code',
    'spa' => 'authorization_code_pkce',
    default => 'client_credentials'
};

$flow = select(
    'Which authentication flow should I set up?',
    [
        'client_credentials' => 'Client Credentials (App-only access) [RECOMMENDED for your setup]',
        'authorization_code' => 'Authorization Code (User authorization required)',
    ],
    default: $flowRecommendation,
    hint: 'I recommend Client Credentials for your API-focused Laravel app'
);
```

### Phase 4: Scope Selection with Visual Guide

**Interactive Scope Picker:**
```php
$scopes = multiselect(
    'Which Spotify permissions do you need?',
    [
        'user-read-private' => 'Read user profile data',
        'user-read-email' => 'Read user email address',
        'playlist-read-private' => 'Read private playlists',
        'playlist-modify-public' => 'Modify public playlists',
        'user-library-read' => 'Read saved tracks and albums',
        'user-top-read' => 'Read top artists and tracks',
        'user-read-recently-played' => 'Read recently played tracks',
    ],
    default: ['user-read-private', 'user-read-email'],
    hint: 'I\'ve pre-selected common permissions. Use space to select/deselect.'
);
```

### Phase 5: Browser-Integrated OAuth Flow

**Local Callback Server Setup:**
```
🚀 Starting local OAuth server on http://localhost:8080...

I'll open your browser for Spotify authorization.
When you approve, I'll automatically capture your tokens!

Status: [██████████████████████████████] Server ready
```

**Browser Authorization:**
```
🌐 Opening Spotify authorization...

In your browser:
1. Review the requested permissions
2. Click "Agree" to authorize
3. I'll handle the rest automatically!

[Waiting for authorization...]
```

**Token Capture & Validation:**
```
✅ Authorization successful!
🔍 Validating tokens with Spotify API...
✅ Access token is valid!
✅ All requested scopes are working!
```

### Phase 6: Environment Configuration & Security

**Smart .env Management:**
```
📝 Updating your .env file...

✅ Created backup: .env.backup.2024-06-25-14-30-15
✅ Added SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
✅ Added SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
✅ Added SPOTIFY_DEFAULT_MARKET=US (detected from your location)
✅ Configured optimal cache settings
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Automatic .env backup with timestamp
- Validate .env permissions (not world-readable)
- Add .env.backup.* to .gitignore if missing
- Warn about credential security

### Phase 7: API Testing & Validation Suite

**Comprehensive API Testing:**
```php
$tests = [
    'Connection Test' => fn() => $this->testBasicConnection(),
    'Authentication' => fn() => $this->testAuthentication(),
    'Scope Validation' => fn() => $this->testScopes(),
    'Rate Limiting' => fn() => $this->testRateLimiting(),
    'Error Handling' => fn() => $this->testErrorHandling(),
];

progress(
    label: 'Testing your Spotify API setup...',
    steps: $tests,
    callback: function ($test, $progress) {
        $result = $test();
        $progress->hint = $result['message'];
        return $result;
    }
);
```

### Phase 8: Personalized Code Generation

**Generate Custom Examples:**
```php
// Detect Laravel app structure and generate relevant examples
$examples = [];

if ($this->hasLivewire()) {
    $examples[] = $this->generateLivewireComponent();
}

if ($this->hasInertia()) {
    $examples[] = $this->generateInertiaController();
}

if ($this->hasApiRoutes()) {
    $examples[] = $this->generateApiController();
}

$this->generatePersonalizedDocumentation($examples);
```

**Sample Generated Controller:**
```php
// Generated specifically for their Laravel setup
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Jordanpartridge\SpotifyClient\Contracts\SpotifyClientInterface;

class SpotifyController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly SpotifyClientInterface $spotify
    ) {}

    public function getAlbum(string $id)
    {
        $album = $this->spotify->albums()->get($id);
        
        // Return formatted for your Laravel setup
        return response()->json($album->json());
    }
}
```

### Phase 9: Integration Suggestions & Setup

**Package Ecosystem Integration:**
```php
$recommendations = [];

if ($this->hasLivewire()) {
    $recommendations[] = 'I can create a Livewire component for playlist management';
}

if ($this->hasFilament()) {
    $recommendations[] = 'I can generate a Filament resource for Spotify data';
}

if ($this->hasQueue()) {
    $recommendations[] = 'I can set up background jobs for playlist sync';
}

if (!empty($recommendations)) {
    $setupExtras = multiselect(
        'Want me to set up any additional integrations?',
        $recommendations,
        hint: 'These will save you even more development time!'
    );
}
```
